# zoomkontrol
This project lets an ESP32 development board act as a BLE keyboard that can control Zoom's mute and video status.

Overview

ZoomKontrol connects wirelessly to any iPad, Chromebook or other Bluetooth device and provides a dedicated hardware button to control audio mute and video on/off.  

ZoomKontrol uses an ESP32 development board to simulate a bluetooth keyboard and execute Zoom compatible keyboard shortcuts at the touch of a button.
