# zoomkontrol
This project lets an ESP32 development board act as a BLE keyboard that can control Zoom's mute and video status.

Overview

ZoomKontrol connects wirelessly to any iPad, Chromebook or other Bluetooth device and provides a dedicated hardware button to control audio mute and video on/off.  

ZoomKontrol uses an ESP32 development board to simulate a bluetooth keyboard and execute Zoom compatible keyboard shortcuts at the touch of a button.

Detailed build instructions are in the ZoomKontrol-instructions PDF in this repository or available here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E1c8e0VX80Z21c_bxWHuH6HKF56w0JPz2Y9CqAWMl74/edit?usp=sharing
